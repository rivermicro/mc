Dynamic file list
Options > Layout > Dynamic file list
The file list updates automatically using Linux’s inotify filesystem notifications, so you don’t need to refresh or rescan. Rapid change events are debounced to keep the interface smooth and prevent flickering. Size changes to existing files are tracked too, so growth/shrink updates the panel.

Internal editor default
Editing from file associations now defaults to the built-in mcedit (falls back to $EDITOR if set), so source and text files open inside mc out of the box.
